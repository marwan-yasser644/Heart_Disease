❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project
This project aims to analyze medical data and build a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients.

📊 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on several medical features.

🧠 Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Preprocess and clean the dataset
Train machine learning models
Evaluate model performance
Save and reuse trained models
