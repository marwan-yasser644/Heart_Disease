# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to analyze medical data and build a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on several medical features.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess and clean the dataset
- Train machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance
- Save and reuse trained models
